cdnpoli-src
==============================

These models drive cdnpo.li, a forecasting site for Canadian politics based on polling information.

### Project Status

This project is very much in its preliminary phases. The polling information is based on a weighted, optimized, expontential weighted moving average, which yields good results retrospectively, and predicted the Alberta provincial election reasonably well. There is much more research to be done on this topic.
